### Reflection
<p>
  During this industrial talk by Credence, I have learned about what exactly data analytics and software development are. 
  I’ll always self-study to gain extra knowledge regarding system development. I’ll learn different programming languages that are 
  useful for a system developer and also always keep myself updated with the latest technology. 
  For example, I would learn through websites such as Coursera to get certificates that
  are authorized to make sure that my skills can be validated when I apply for jobs in my future career. Besides that,
  I will practice my soft skills, such as communication skills and leadership skills, by attending camps and webinars
  to learn from those who are more experienced and improve myself. I would also look for internships so that I can
  learn more actual hands-on knowledge and gain more experience so that I can adapt more easily to the working
  environment after I have graduated.
